#3. Given two numeric vectors of equal length, write R code to check if they are element-wise equal and then output
#the indices where they differ using the which() function.

vec1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
vec2 <- c(1, 3, 3, 7, 5)
differences <- which(vec1 != vec2)
print(differences)

#OUTPUT
#[1] 2 4
