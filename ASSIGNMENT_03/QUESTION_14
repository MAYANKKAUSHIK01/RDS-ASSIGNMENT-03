#14. Given a factor vector of genders (e.g., gender <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male", "female"))), write R
#code to extract only the entries corresponding to "female".

gender_factor <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male", "female"))
females <- gender_factor[gender_factor == "female"]
print(females)

#OUTPUT
#[1] female female female
#Levels: female male
